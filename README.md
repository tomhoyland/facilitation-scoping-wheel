**What is it?**

The Facilitation Scoping Wheel is a structured and interactive template designed for agile practitioners, facilitators, business analysts, product owners, and consultants.

It helps to effectively scope workshops, events, or retrospectives by guiding facilitators and clients through a sequence of questions to gather sufficient information for designing, planning, and structuring successful events.

The Facilitation Scoping Wheel covers pre-event preparation, elements required during an event for increased success, and the desired atmosphere or metaphor that aligns with the client's vision for the event. It enables facilitators to validate and refine their understanding of client needs, increasing clarity and alignment.

**Who is it for?**
•	Facilitators, Agile Coaches, Product Owners, Business Analysts, and Consultants.
•	Practitioners looking to scope events or workshops with clients.
•	Teams seeking a structured approach to plan and align on workshops, retrospectives, or group activities.

**How to use it**
1.	Initiate the Scoping Conversation: Introduce the client to the structure, intent, and purpose of the Facilitation Scoping Wheel. Timebox the entire conversation, letting the client know how the information surfaced during the session will be used and what decisions it will support. Then, begin to progress through the wheel and its questions.
2.	Timebox Each Area: Allocate time for each question or area to ensure focused and efficient discussions. Timeboxing helps maintain momentum and keeps the session on track.
3.	Review and Iterate: As you progress through the questions, revisit earlier responses if new information surfaces. This iterative process ensures alignment and a shared understanding between the facilitator and the client.
4.	Move Sequentially or Dynamically: Use the Facilitation Scoping Wheel sequentially by following the flow of questions clockwise, or adapt by returning to previous questions as new insights arise.
5.	Clarify Expectations: Use the template to set mutual expectations regarding the facilitator's style and the client's needs. This helps foster a collaborative planning environment where both parties actively contribute to the event's success.

**When to use it**
The Facilitation Scoping Wheel is particularly effective for initial client engagements, helping to establish a clear understanding of needs, challenges, and desired outcomes. It encourages clients to take ownership of the planning process, resulting in a more engaged and responsible approach to the event's success.
